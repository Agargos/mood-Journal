## 🧠 AI & Mental Health Insights

We use lightweight AI models (DeepSeek or Hugging Face) to:
- Detect emotional tone from user text
- Predict potential future moods based on trends

This provides proactive mental health nudges like:
_"You might feel low this weekend, consider a relaxing activity."_
